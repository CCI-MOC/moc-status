========================
HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE
========================

Creating a new status entry:

1. Set `title:` to a descriptive title.

2. Remove `published: false`.

3. Optionally set a `severity`. By default, posts have a severity of 1
   (mild). You can also select 0 (low) or 2 (critical).

4. Save this as _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md.

Marking an existing status entry as resolved:

1. Remove the `state` setting from the frontmatter.
