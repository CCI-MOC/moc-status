title: Data Center Annual Maintenance Scheduled May 23-26, 2022
state: active
severity: 0
---

Due to a scheduled power outage at the MGHPCC data center, MOC services will be
unavailable from Monday, May 23, 2022 at 6PM through Thursday, May 26, 2022 at
12PM.  This is buffered before and after the power actual power outage to allow
MOC maintenance.

Please shut down your virtual machines, containers, and any bare metal systems
by 9 AM on Monday, August 9, so that the Mass Open Cloud team may begin
preparing for the outage. If you do not shut them down yourself, you run the
risk of losing data.

The MOC has dependencies on several services which also run at the data center.
Based on previous experience we recommend not scheduling critical events the
week of May 23rd.

If you will need access to any MOC hosted data during this outage, please make
sure to obtain copies of that data prior to Monday, May 23rd. During the
outage, the data center will be completely without power and access to MOC
hosted services will be impossible.

As always, if you have questions feel free to open a [support ticket][ticket].
The ticketing system will be available throughout the outage.
