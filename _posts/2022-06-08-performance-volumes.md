title: Performance Volume and/or OpenShift Backup Reminder
severity: 0
---

If you are using the performance volumes and/or OpenShift now is a great time
to backup your data. We are doing hardware maintenance on the performance
volumes. It will be several weeks before some parts are available and there
is a heightened risk of data loss during that time.

Thanks
