title: Kaizen OpenStack SSL certificate update
---

We are performing some routine maintenance on the Kaizen cluster
tomorrow, Apr 12 2021, at 9:30AM.  We will be updating the expired SSL
certificates. We do not expect any service interruption, but similar
maintenance work in the past has trigged unexpected problems.

If you have a project on Kaizen Openstack or Kaizen OpenShift, you may
want to stop the project while this maintenance is going on. This
maintenance will not impact the Zero OpenShift cluster, Power 9
cluster, or bare metal nodes.

The maintenance will begin at 9:30am and finish by noon.  We will
update this website when the maintenance is complete.
