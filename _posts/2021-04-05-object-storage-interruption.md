We have repaired the Ceph storage issues that impacted the OpenStack
Swift/S3 service on Kaizen OpenStack and the object storage service is
once again available. We are continuing to work with Red Hat support
to diagnose some lingering problems that are impacting the health of
the Ceph cluster.

We will post an update when the issue has been fully resolved.
