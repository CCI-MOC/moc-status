Thank you for your patience. This annual power-down helps MGHPCC to perform
maintenance that would otherwise require massive year-round power redundancy.
This keeps cost and excess energy usage down and maintains its LEED Platinum
standing as a green data center.

The Mass Open Cloud services are available for use with one exception:

- We are working on getting the ocp-prod cluster back up. We currently do not
have a time frame. We will update this page as we gather more information.
