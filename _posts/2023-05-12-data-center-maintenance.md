title: Data Center Annual Maintenance Scheduled June 5-12, 2023
state: active
severity: 0
---

Due to the annually scheduled maintenance power outage at the MGHPCC data center, MOC services will be unavailable from Tuesday, June 5th, 2023 at 6 PM through Friday, June 12th, 2023 at 12 AM.

Please shut down your virtual machines, containers, and any bare metal systems by 6 PM on Monday, June 5th, so that the Mass Open Cloud team may begin preparing for the outage. If you do not shut them down yourself, you run the risk of losing data.

The MOC has dependencies on several services which also run at the data center. Based on previous experience we recommend not scheduling critical events the week of June 5th.

We will notify you when MOC services are available by updating the MOC status website at https://status.massopen.cloud/ and by sending an email to this distribution list. Once services are back online it will be your responsibility to restart any virtual machines, containers, or other systems.

If you will need access to any MOC-hosted data during this outage, please make sure to obtain copies of that data prior to Monday, June 5th. During the outage, the data center will be completely without power and access to MOC-hosted services will be impossible.

As always, if you have questions feel free to open a [support ticket][ticket].
The ticketing system will be available throughout the outage.
