state: active

Due to the annual scheduled maintenance power outage at the MGHPCC
data center, MOC services will be unavailable from Monday, June 5th,
2023, at 9 am until Monday, June 12th, 2023, at 5 pm.

Please shut down your containers and bare metal systems by 9 am on
Monday, June 5th, so the Mass Open Cloud team may begin preparing for
the outage. If you do not shut them down yourself, you risk losing data.

We will notify you when MOC services are available by updating the
MOC status [website][status] and emailing this distribution list.
MOC services may be available earlier than June 12th.

Once services are back online, you will be responsible for restarting
any containers or other systems.

If you need access to any MOC-hosted data during this outage, please
obtain copies of your data before Monday, June 5th. During the outage,
the data center will be entirely without power, and access to
MOC-hosted services will be impossible.

As always, if you have questions, open a [support ticket][ticket].
The ticketing system will be available throughout the outage.
