A network slowdown has impacted several projects. To repair the
problem will require physical maintenance this Friday, April 9th,
between 1 and 3 pm.

K-Openshift and Kaizen Openstack will not be available during that
time.  If a lack of network access may impact your project, you should
consider pausing it before the maintenance work starts.

We do not expect the Power 9 or Zero clusters to be affected.
Nevertheless, it is probably a good idea not to plan critical work on
the afternoon of Friday, April 9th.
