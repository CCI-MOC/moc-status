K-Openshift and Kaizen Openstack will not be available between 1pm and
3pm today, Friday, April 9. Our partners will be performing network
maintenance in an attempt to address recent reports of slow network
performance.

While we do not expect the Power 9 or Zero clusters to be affected,
you may want to postpone any critical work until after the
maintenance work is complete.

We will post an update on this status page when network access has
been restored.
