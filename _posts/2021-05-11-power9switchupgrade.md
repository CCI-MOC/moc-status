We plan to upgrade the power 9 cluster switch today at 3pm, this will prevent access to the Power 9 cluster until the upgrade is complete.

Details: IBM support has requested that we update the firmware in the switch which controls the power 9 systems as part of troubleshooting problems with several machines in the power cluster. 

We would like to start that process today at 3pm (Boston Time/east coast).  Please open a ticket before 2:30pm (Boston/east coast) at osticket.massopen.cloud if this will affect work you are in the middle of on the Power 9 clusters. 

Please check https://status.massopen.cloud/ for updates on whether we start at 3 and details on when the update is complete.
