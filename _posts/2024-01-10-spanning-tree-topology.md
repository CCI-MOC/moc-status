title: February 5th ESI Network Downtime
severity: 1

---

Downtime is planned for February 5th, 2024 starting at 10am EST for parts of the MOC Alliance network. This will affect ESI and projects which rely on it. Please make sure all work on the ESI nodes is ready for network downtime on the 5th. We will update this [status][status] page once the work is done and the network is working again. The downtime is to deploy a new spanning tree topology, which will require restarting many of the production switches.

Have a wonderful day!

Thanks!
