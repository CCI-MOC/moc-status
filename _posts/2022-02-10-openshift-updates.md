Hello OpenShift Users

From now on we will be updating our OpenShift4 cluster on the first and third monday over every month at 10:00 AM EST. We will not send announcements before these updates since they should not be noticeable.

We will continue to make announcements for maintenance that may cause service interruption.

Thanks
MOC Staff
