title: OpenShift Cluster Update Schedule
severity: 0
---
OpenShift cluster `ocp-prod` will now be updated every first and third Monday of every month at 10:00 AM.
We will not send out annoucements before these updates since they should not be noticeable.

We will continue to make announcements for maintenance that may cause service interruption.

Thanks
MOC Staff
